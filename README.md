#Super Meat Boy
The goal is to get to bandagegirl. Supermeatboy was a huge game released on xbox arcade, and was well-known for being ridiculous difficulty. I played this game a lot with my dad and sister, and it is one of my favorite games to play. From the beautiful art, to the fantastic level design, to the exciting mechanics, Supermeatboy is regarded as one of the most fun and challenging platformers to exist. So, I made a clone of Supermeatboy and had a blast creating levels and learning java. The levels are original, and we built the game engine from scratch as well to understand collision detection, physics, graphics, and animations 
mote intimately.
